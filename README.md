# Instaclone, a photo sharing web application

This is a web application I built as a side project to improve my web development skills. For the backend,it is built with Go as the primary language and PostgreSQL for the database. For the frontend, it is mainly built with Go's html/template library, along with some Bootstrap components. The UI uses [Instagram Web App](http://www.instagram.com "Instagram Web App")'s design as reference.

## Deployment
The application is currently deployed to Digital Ocean, running on top of Caddy web server. Caddy web server is an open source web server with multiple advantages: it is easy to configure, provides HTTP/2 support and also have a conveneint SSL configuration with Letâ€™s Encrypt. Therefore, these are the reason I am using it instead of the more common ones like Nginx or Apache.
